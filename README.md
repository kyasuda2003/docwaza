This's a repo in the effort to keep and maintain the jodconverter (by mirkonasato) up-to-date. Under the license of GNU you can freely redistribute, fork and modify it.

Additionally, out of personal interests, I maintain/write the test class in supporting the openoffice 4.x in a hope that this can be a good resource to your projects. It's passed my test. However, you're welcomed to use it at your own risk.

Please feel free to create an issue as I tend to work swiftly to resolving it. I'll answer any questions on a daily basis.
